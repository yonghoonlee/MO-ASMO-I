% This routine evaluates the derivative based on all points
% in the stencils.  It is more memory efficient than "fd_weights"
% 
% This set of routines comes from the appendix of 
% A Practical Guide to Pseudospectral Methods, B. Fornberg
% Cambridge Univ. Press, 1996.   (pff)
% 
% Input parameters:
%   xx -- point at wich the approximations are to be accurate
%   x  -- array of x-ordinates:   x(0:n)
%   m  -- highest order of derivative to be approxxmated at xi
% 
% Output:
%   c  -- set of coefficients c(0:n,0:m).
%         c(j,k) is to be applied at x(j) when
%         the kth derivative is approximated by a 
%         stencil extending over x(0),x(1),...x(n).
%

% UPDATED 8/26/03 to account for matlab "+1" index shift.
% Follows p. 168--169 of Fornberg's book.
